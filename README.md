# tribalscalecalculator

I chose Selenium to automate this test case for the following;

    1. It is open source.
    2. It is compatible with any browser
    3. It is compatible with any programming language.
    4. It can run multiple test cases in multiple browsers
    
    
I chose C# as the programming language for this test due to the following:

    1. It has a lot of built-in functions which makes the process move fast.
    2. Its IDE (Visual Studio) gives me a faster development and debugging experience
